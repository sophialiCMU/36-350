HW9
Q1: just need a histogram
- purple line at -0.5

Q2: Scatter plot comparing x1 and x3 after sampling
- means for each axis average(x1)

Q3:
- same Q2 but x2 instead
- scatterplot

Q4: conditional
- show output corr matix for x1 and x3
- conditional not correlational matrix?

Q4: similar Q2 and Q3
- draw from two different dist.
- 2 colors in plot saying which it comes from
- after regression, show incorrect points [0,1]

Q5: 
- use 90% rule to determine # principal compents to keep
- proportion output
- table showing each prin. comp. mapped to original variable on top
- comments at end entailing which 3 are important and which aren't
- which variable has highest compenent on each component

Q6:
- regular regression
- r^2 value of model [0,1]
- sum of square errors (larger)

- another model from Q5
- same stuff as before
- comment at end about two r^2 of two models
